I'm Engineering Manager with more than 8 years of experience in IT. 
These years, I've been concentrated on Java based development, performing the Technical Lead role as well, and manage full-stack teams. 

I participated in [hackathons](https://dev.by/lenta/epam-systems/chem-polezny-hakatony-istoriya-odnogo-proekta), where I brought teams to win,
facilitate and contribute to the Belarussian [“Java Professionals BY”](https://jprof.by) community and an [active speaker](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL0VRD9GZQoQTPSysQ0__Lvt3nAtX9AcYE). 
Make my best contribution to the product, with close attention to details that build the whole picture.
