I am a full-stack Java developer with 5 years of development experience. 
For several years, I have been concentrated on Java and Javascript service development, performing the Technical Lead role as well.

I participated in [hackathons](https://dev.by/lenta/epam-systems/chem-polezny-hakatony-istoriya-odnogo-proekta), where I brought teams to win,
co-leader of Belarus JUG [“Java Professionals BY”](http://jprof.by) community and an [active speaker](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL0VRD9GZQoQTPSysQ0__Lvt3nAtX9AcYE). 
I’m delighted with Kotlin and Clojure. Make my best contribution to the product, with close attention to details that build the whole picture.

Interested in Java server-side development, data processing, integrations and machine learning as well.
